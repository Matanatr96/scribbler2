1) Our movie depics a scene in the scribbler world cup where there's one 
	minute on the clock. There are two robots; defender and attacker, while
	another one is filing. the attacker makes a move around the defender and
	scores a goal. Then he celebrates. We used the seeing red effect and the 
	negative effect and the fading effect too. If you can tell, our movie zooms
	in and out. We though it added effect, it wasnt one of our coding effects.

2) We did not deviate from the rubric at all. All the requirements are met.
