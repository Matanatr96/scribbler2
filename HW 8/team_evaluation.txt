1) My name: Anush Mattapalli
   Partner: Aaron Wasserman
   Partner: Colin Brandys

2) I wrote the performance code and some of the editing code.
   along with some of the attacker. Aaron did the defender and some of the filming code,
   and worked on a 3rd party program to make the movie. Colin wrote some of the editing 
   code and some of the filming code.

3) I believe that we all did equal work in this project and deserve 33.33%. This project 
   was a pain in the butt, but we all pulled through and made a great movie.
